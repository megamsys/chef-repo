ghostblog CHANGELOG
===================
v1.0.5
------
- Errors in config.js fixed.

v1.0.4
------
- Made a change on ghost recipe to change distribution from a hardcode to node attribute

v1.0.3
------
- Made some suggestions based on foodcritic.

v1.0.2
------
- There was already a `ghost` cookbook on the Supermarket, so I had to change the name of mine to `ghost-blog`. Because of this the cookbook broke. Renamed all mention of "ghost" to "ghost-blog". This should fix the cookbook now.

v1.0.1
------
- No changes to the cookbook code. All the changes were related to uploading to [SuperMarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks)

v1.0.0
------
- Initial relase
